The first step to customizing the existing rules and settings is to create a \nbh_core.sublime-settings\n in your \nUser\n folder.  With this file you can override any of the settings or bracket rules.  By changing these settings, you can add support for new languages, or change the look of highlighting, and much more.\n\n\nCore Visual Settings\n\ue157\n\n\nThese are the settings related to the visual appearance of \nBH\n.\n\n\nshow_in_minimap\n\ue157\n\n\nShows highlighted brackets in the minimap.  This will work with all highlight styles except \nunderline\n; \nthin_underline\n has no issues.\n\n\n    \n// Show brackets in the minimap.\n\n    \nshow_in_minimap\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nshow_unmatched\n\ue157\n\n\nDisplays a special highlight for brackets that cannot be matched.\n\n\n    \n// When only either the left or right bracket can be found\n\n    \n// this defines if the unmatched bracket should be shown.\n\n    \nshow_unmatched\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nshow_unmatched_exceptions\n\ue157\n\n\nList of languages in which the \nshow_unmatched\n option logic will be reversed.\n\n\n    \n// Do the opposite of \nshow_unmatched\n for the languages listed below\n\n    \nshow_unmatched_exceptions\n:\n \n[],\n\n\n\n\n\ncontent_highlight_bar\n\ue157\n\n\nAn experimental setting which can enable the display of a vertical bar that extends from the line containing the opening bracket to the line with the closing bracket.  Takes a boolean of \ntrue\n or \nfalse\n.  When \nalign_content_highlight_bar\n is set to \nfalse\n, the bar will be shown on the first column regardless of indent level of the brackets.  When \nalign_content_highlight_bar\n is set to \ntrue\n, the bar will be aligned at the bracket indent level.\n\n\n    \n// Experimental: Creates a visible bar at the beginning of all lines between\n\n    \n// multiline bracket spans.\n\n    \ncontent_highlight_bar\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nshow_in_widgets\n\ue157\n\n\nAn experimental setting that enables bracket highlighting in widgets (panels etc.).  By default, \nBH\n does not highlight any brackets in plain text which is what the majority of the widget text boxes are.  Regex search boxes are not plain text and \nshould\n get bracket highlighting.\n\n\n    \n// Experimental: Allow bracket highlighter to search in widgets.\n\n    \n// Most widgets use Plain Text which BH should ignore,\n\n    \n// But regex find views views are usually regular expression\n\n    \n// Which should be the only views to trigger BH.\n\n    \nsearch_in_widgets\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput panels are widgets as well, but sometimes the widget flag gets removed from them (Sublime issue). So this flag may or may not affect the output panel depending on its state.  If you are a developer and wish to ensure an output panel that is created by your plugin does \nnot\n have bracket highlighting, you can set the following setting to the view as \nTrue\n: \nbracket_highlighter.ignore\n.\n\n\nalign_content_highlight_bar\n\ue157\n\n\nModifies the behavior of \ncontent_highlight_bar\n and draws the vertical content bar at the indentation level of the highlighted bracket, but there are some limitations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content bar cannot extend through an empty line unless the bar is on the first column.  This is a limitation of the Sublime API.  Empty lines will cause a gap in the bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content bar will not be shown on a line where non-whitespace characters cross the bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n// Experimental: Align the content highlight bar at the bracket indent level\n\n    \nalign_content_highlight_bar\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nhigh_visibility_enabled_by_default\n\ue157\n\n\nEnables high visibility mode by default.  High visibility mode highlights not only the bracket but the content between as well, but it is disabled by default and must be toggled on to be used.  This reverses the behavior and has it on by default. Takes a boolean \ntrue\n or \nfalse\n.\n\n\n    \n// Enable high visibility by default when sublime starts up\n\n    \nhigh_visibility_enabled_by_default\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nhigh_visibility_style\n\ue157\n\n\nModifies the styling of high visibility mode.  The available options are \nsolid\n, \noutline\n, \nunderline\n, \nthin_underline\n, \nsquiggly\n, and \nstippled\n.\n\n\n    \n// High visibility style and color for high visibility mode\n\n    \nhigh_visibility_style\n:\n \noutline\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nhigh_visibility_color\n\ue157\n\n\nModifies the high visibility color.  There are three types of settings you can use:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__default__\n is a special reserved value which will use the color set in \nbracket_styles\n.  See \nConfiguring Highlight Style\n for more info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__bracket__\n is a special reserved value which will inherit the defined color of the highlighted bracket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny valid scope found in your color scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n// Color for high visibility mode\n\n    \nhigh_visibility_color\n:\n \n__bracket__\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nBehavioral Settings\n\ue157\n\n\nThese settings affect the matching behavior.\n\n\nmatch_only_adjacent\n\ue157\n\n\nCauses \nBH\n to only match and highlight brackets when the cursor is adjacent to a bracket.\n\n\n    \n// Match brackets only when the cursor is touching the inside of the bracket\n\n    \nmatch_only_adjacent\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nbracket_outside_adjacent\n\ue157\n\n\nAugments the matching behavior and will trigger matching when the cursor is adjacent to a cursor on the outside (not between the brackets).\n\n\n    \n// Outside adjacent bracket matching\n\n    \nbracket_outside_adjacent\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nblock_cursor_mode\n\ue157\n\n\nExperimental setting that modifies the bracket matching mode for block cursor.  The bracket matching mode is one that makes a little more sense to some people in regards to the visual representation of block cursors.  In this mode, brackets will match when the cursor is right before the bracket (or if using a block cursor, highlighting the character). So if you are someone that uses block cursors and find that toggling \nbracket_outside_adjacent\n still doesn't quite match brackets how you would like, you can give this setting a try. It has also been mentioned that this makes sense with Vim.\n\n\nWhen this setting is enabled, \nbracket_outside_adjacent\n will be ignored.\n\n\n    \n// Experimental: Special matching mode for block cursor.\n\n    \n// Essentially, this provides a matching mode that makes a little more\n\n    \n// sense to some in regards to the visual representation of block cursors.\n\n    \n// This will ignore \nbracket_outside_adjacent\n.\n\n    \nblock_cursor_mode\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nignore_outside_adjacent_in_plugin\n\ue157\n\n\nIgnores the \nbracket_outside_adjacent\n setting when running a plugin \nif\n the plugin sets \nno_outside_adj\n to \nnull\n (\nnull\n for JSON or \nNone\n in Python).\n\n\n    \n// When \nbracket_outside_adjacet\n is set, and a plugin command explicitly sets\n\n    \n// \nno_outside_adj\n \nNone\n instead of \ntrue\n or the default \nfalse\n,\n\n    \n// this value will be used.\n\n    \nignore_outside_adjacent_in_plugin\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nignore_block_mode_in_plugin\n\ue157\n\n\nExperimental setting that ignores the \nblock_cursor_mode\n setting when running a plugin \nif\n the plugin sets \nno_block_mode\n to \nnull\n (\nnull\n for JSON or \nNone\n in Python).\n\n\n    \n// When \nblock_cursor_mode\n is set, and a plugin command explicitly sets\n\n    \n// \nno_block_mode\n to \nNone\n instead of \ntrue\n or the default \nfalse\n,\n\n    \n// this value will be used.\n\n    \nignore_block_mode_in_plugin\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nbracket_string_escape_mode\n\ue157\n\n\nDepending on the setting, \nBH\n will either match sub-brackets inside strings with traditional string escape logic, or it will match sub-brackets in strings with regex escape logic.  Takes a string value of either \nregex\n or \nstring\n.\n\n\n    \n// Set mode for string escapes to ignore (regex|string)\n\n    \nbracket_string_escape_mode\n:\n \nstring\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nsearch_threshold\n\ue157\n\n\nSets the search threshold.  The search threshold determines how many characters \nBH\n will search through to find matching brackets before giving up.  This setting only affects auto-matching and not on-demand calls from the command palette and menu. By default, this value is very conservative and can be increased.  Keep in mind that a very large value may impact performance.\n\n\n    \n// Character threshold to search\n\n    \nsearch_threshold\n:\n \n5000\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nignore_threshold\n\ue157\n\n\nCauses the \nsearch_threshold\n limit to be ignored.  It is not advised to use this as very large files may cause a noticeable performance hit, but has been made available due to a number of requests.\n\n\n    \n// Ignore threshold\n\n    \nignore_threshold\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nauto_selection_threshold\n\ue157\n\n\nA numerical value which controls the maximum number of simultaneous auto-matched brackets that are allowed.  This setting will not be considered when running on-demand calls via the command palette or menu.\n\n\n    \n// Set max number of multi-select brackets that will be searched automatically\n\n    \nauto_selection_threshold\n \n:\n \n10\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nkill_highlight_on_threshold\n\ue157\n\n\nCompletely kills highlighting when \nauto_selection_threshold\n is exceeded.  When disabled, \nBH\n will just highlight up to the threshold limit.\n\n\n    \n// Enable this to completely kill highlighting if \nauto_selection_threshold\n\n    \n// is exceeded.  Default is to highlight up to the \nauto_selection_threshold\n.\n\n    \nkill_highlight_on_threshold\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nno_multi_select_icons\n\ue157\n\n\nDisables gutter icons when doing multiple selections.\n\n\n    \n// Disable gutter icons when doing multi-select\n\n    \nno_multi_select_icons\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nPopup Settings\n\ue157\n\n\nSettings related to the new popup hints when brackets are offscreen.\n\n\nshow_offscreen_bracket_popup\n\ue157\n\n\nSetting this will show a popup when the mouse hovers over a visible bracket and its matching pair is offscreen.  The popup will show about 120 chars of context for every line shown.  Additionally, if the offscreen bracket is located on a separate line, it will show an additional line(s) of context before and after.  The context is shown in plain text, but the bracket will be emphasized by making the bracket bold and colorizing it with the your theme's keyword color.  \nCharacter context\n, \nline context\n, and \nemphasis color\n can all be configured in the settings file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a bracket was unmatched with an invalid highlight, you can mouse over it and will get the unmatched popup that explains the reasons why an unmatched bracket might occur.  It also offers the option to attempt matching without the threshold.\n\n\n\n\n    \n// Show hover popup\n\n    \n// This will show a hover popup when mousing over\n\n    \n// the visible bracket if the other\n\n    \n// highlighted matching bracket is off screen.\n\n    \n// It will show line text of the off screen bracket -/+ 128 chars\n\n    \n// from the bracket start and end points.\n\n    \n// A link will be available allowing the user to click and jump to\n\n    \n// the other bracket.\n\n    \nshow_offscreen_bracket_popup\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\npopup_char_context\n\ue157\n\n\nThis determines the amount of characters per line of context that are allowed in the popup that is generated by \nshow_offscreen_bracket_popup\n.  By default, this setting is set to \n120\n.  If you desire a different amount, you can specify it here.\n\n\n    \n// Adjust char per line context of bracket popup.\n\n    \npopup_char_context\n:\n \n120\n,\n\n\n\n\n\npopup_line_context\n\ue157\n\n\nSetting this determines the amount of additional lines of context that are allowed in the popup that is generated by \nshow_offscreen_bracket_popup\n.  \npopup_line_context\n is only applied to brackets that are not on the same line as the visible bracket. This value is split and half the lines will be gathered from before the line of interest and half from after the line of interest.  It is recommend to use even numbers.  Line context is a bit dynamic in the sense that if \nX\n number of lines cannot be gathered from before, the additional lines will be applied after; the inverse is true in regards to lines after.\n\n\n    \n// Adjust number of lines of additional context\n\n    \n// that are shown when brackets are vertically off screen.\n\n    \n// Specified line count is split to context before and after the target line.\n\n    \n// So a value of 4 would give you two lines of context before and two lines after.\n\n    \npopup_line_context\n:\n \n2\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nuse_custom_popup_bracket_emphasis\n\ue157\n\n\nThis experimental setting allows you to override the default popup bracket emphasis which is calculated based on what scope/color you have assigned to the matched bracket style.  With this setting enabled, you can use the setting \npopup_bracket_emphasis\n to control the color of the popup bracket emphasis.  This will default to \ntrue\n if you don't have the MdPopups version which supports guessing the correct color.\n\n\n    \n// Use \npopup_bracket_emphasis\n to customize the popup\ns bracket emphasis color\n\n    \nuse_custom_popup_bracket_emphasis\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\npopup_bracket_emphasis\n\ue157\n\n\nThis setting dictates what color is used to emphasize the off screen bracket in the popup that is generated by \nshow_offscreen_bracket_popup\n.  Colors can either be specified by a standard \nTextMate scopes\n (the popup library being used is MdPopups, and it scans your theme for standard TextMate scopes and creates the necessary CSS for the popups), or you can specify a hex color in the form of \n#rgb\n or \n#rrggbb\n.  Due to limitations in Sublime's HTML renderer, scopes that define background colors will most likely not show the background color.  The default setting is \n#ff0000\n.\n\n\nOutside of the scopes generated by MdPopups, it is likely that your theme may have additionally included scopes.  Sublime seems to include these by default (but your mileage may vary):\n\n\n\n\nerror\n\n\ndeleted\n\n\nsuccess\n\n\ninserted\n\n\nwarning\n\n\nmodified\n\n\n\n\n    \n// Specify the scope (to get color) to emphasize the off screen bracket\n\n    \n// in popups.

If this is undesirable for any reason (development or you just don't like things upgrading without your explicit say so), then set this to \nfalse\n.\n\n\n    \n// Try to ensure dependencies are up to date.\n\n    \n// If it is not desirable to have this done (like developing) on a specific dependency,\n\n    \n// or some other reason, set this to False.\n\n    \nupgrade_dependencies\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nTag Plugin Settings\n\ue157\n\n\nThis section covers settings found in \nbh_tag.sublime-settings\n.

Each key represents a tag mode such as: \nhtml\n, \nxhtml\n, \ncfml\n, etc.  All of these are exposed so that even non-standard HTML syntax can be supported.\n\n\n\n\nAttention!\n\n\nMore tag mode keys can be added, but they \nmust\n be added to \nevery\n setting with valid parameters.\n\n\n\n\ntag_mode\n\ue157\n\n\nA list that contains a dictionary of different modes.  Each mode tweaks the tag matching for the respective mode.  Each entry in the list consists of a dictionary with the keys \nmode\n, \nsyntax\n, and the optional \nfirst_line\n. \nmode\n specifies the mode name.  \nsyntax\n is a list of languages that are allowed in that mode. \nfirst_line\n (which is optional) is a regular expression that is applied to the first line in the file as a condition for selecting that mode.  The \ntag_mode\n list is evaluated in order from top to bottom and selects the first entry that matches all the criteria.\n\n\n    \n// Determine which style of tag-matching to use in which syntax.\n\n    \ntag_mode\n:\n \n[\n\n        \n{\nmode\n:\n \nxml\n,\n \nsyntax\n:\n \n[\nXML\n]},\n\n        \n{\n\n            \nmode\n:\n \nxhtml\n,\n\n            \nsyntax\n:\n \n[\n\n                \nHTML\n,\n\n                \nHTML 5\n,\n\n                \nPHP\n,\n\n                \nHTML (Jinja Templates)\n,\n\n                \nHTML (Jinja2)\n,\n\n                \nHTML (Rails)\n,\n\n                \nHTML (Twig)\n,\n\n                \nHTML (Django)\n,\n\n                \nlaravel-blade\n,\n\n                \nblade\n,\n\n                \nHandlebars\n,\n\n                \nAngularJS\n,\n\n                \nJava Server Pages (JSP)\n\n            \n],\n\n            \nfirst_line\n:\n \n^[ \\\\t]*\n\\\\?xml\n\n        \n},\n\n        \n{\n\n            \nmode\n:\n \nhtml\n,\n\n            \nsyntax\n:\n \n[\n\n                \nHTML\n,\n\n                \nHTML 5\n,\n\n                \nPHP\n,\n\n                \nHTML (Jinja Templates)\n,\n\n                \nHTML (Jinja2)\n,\n\n                \nHTML (Rails)\n,\n\n                \nHTML (Twig)\n,\n\n                \nHTML (Django)\n,\n\n                \nlaravel-blade\n,\n\n                \nblade\n,\n\n                \nHandlebars\n,\n\n                \nAngularJS\n,\n\n                \nJava Server Pages (JSP)\n\n            \n]\n\n        \n},\n\n        \n{\n\n            \nmode\n:\n \ncfml\n,\n\n            \nsyntax\n:\n \n[\nHTML+CFML\n,\n \nColdFusion\n,\n \nColdFusionCFC\n]\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n],\n\n\n\n\n\ntag_style\n\ue157\n\n\nSets the highlight style for the tag plugin.

Bracket rules are defined with case insensitive regular expressions, syntax scoping, and \nbh_plugins\n.  There are two kinds of brackets you can define.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscope_brackets\n which search the file for scope regions and then use regex to test for opening and closing brackets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbrackets\n which use regex to find opening and closing brackets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nbrackets\n rules should usually be the preferred type.  \nscope_brackets\n are usually used for brackets whose opening and closing are the same. These type are not easily distinguishable from one another by regex. Scope brackets must be contained in a continuous scope region like \nstring\n for quotes etc.\n\n\nBH\n uses a wrapper around Python's re regex library to add support for additional back references.  See the \nExtended Regex Guide\n.\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nBrackets can be modified, or even added, without copying the entire bracket rule list to the user settings.

This was a cumbersome requirement that also punished a user because if they did this, they wouldn't automatically get updates to the rules as all the rules were now overridden by the user's settings file.\n\n\nBracketHighlighter now lets you add or modify existing rules without overriding the entire rule set, or even the entire target rule.  Let's say you have a custom language you want to have on your machine. Now, you can simply add it to one of the two settings arrays: \"user_scope_brackets\" and \"user_brackets\":\n\n\n    \nuser_scope_brackets\n:\n \n[],\n\n    \nuser_brackets\n:\n \n[\n\n        \n{\n\n            \nname\n:\n \nmylang\n,\n\n            \nopen\n:\n \n^\\\\s*\\\\b(if|subr|bytemap|enum|command|for|while|macro|do)\\\\b\n,\n\n            \nclose\n:\n \n\\\\b(e(?:if|subr|bytemap|enum|command|for|while|macro)|until)\\\\b\n,\n\n            \nstyle\n:\n \ndefault\n,\n\n            \nscope_exclude\n:\n \n[\nstring\n,\n \ncomment\n],\n\n            \nplugin_library\n:\n \nUser.bh_modules.mylangkeywords\n,\n\n            \nlanguage_filter\n:\n \nwhitelist\n,\n\n            \nlanguage_list\n:\n \n[\nmylang\n],\n\n            \nenabled\n:\n \ntrue\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n],\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's say you want to modify an existing rule, maybe just tweak the language list. All you have to do is use the same name of the item you want to change.

The name of the style corresponds to a style definition.  Style definitions are defined under \nbracket_styles\n in \nbh_core.sublime-settings\n.\n\n\nThere are two special style definitions whose names are reserved: \ndefault\n and \nunmatched\n, but you can configure them.  All other custom style definitions follow the same pattern.  All styles, even the \nspecial\n styles, follow the same format.  See description below:\n\n\n        \n// \ndefault\n style defines attributes that\n\n        \n// will be used for any style that does not\n\n        \n// explicitly define that attribute.

For instance, below I assign the hash rule for C/C++ preprocessors conditionals to \nbrackethighlighter.c_define\n, but I don't have \nbrackethighlighter.c_define\n in my theme \ndict\n.

These kinds of plugins have three methods you can provide: \npost_match\n, \ncompare\n, and/or \nvalidate\n.\n\n\nvalidate\n\ue157\n\n\n\n\ndef\n \nvalidate\n(\nname\n,\n \nbracket\n,\n \nbracket_size\n,\n \nbfr\n)\n\n\n\n\nvalidate\n is run before comparing the bracket to its corresponding opening or closing partner.  This is used to perform additional validation on a found bracket.  For example, lets say you have a bracket that is case sensitive.  \nBH\n uses a case insensitive search, so with validate, you can ensure the originally found bracket matches the desired case.\n\n\nParameters\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\n\n\nThe name of the bracket definition being evaluated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbracket\n\n\nThe bracket region being validated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbracket_side\n\n\nOpening (0) or closing (1) bracket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbfr\n\n\nThe file buffer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturns\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoolean\n\n\nIndicates whether the validation succeeded \nTrue\n or failed \nFalse\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Should match closing tag \nend\n but not match \nEnd\n\n\ncase\n \nFoo\n \nof\n\n    \nGuard1\n \n-\n \nok\n;\n\n    \nGuard2\n \n-\n \nEnd\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\nExample (from \nlowercase.py\n):\n\n\ndef\n \nvalidate\n(\nname\n,\n \nbracket\n,\n \nbracket_side\n,\n \nbfr\n):\n\n    \nCheck if bracket is lowercase.\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nbfr\n[\nbracket\n.\nbegin\n:\nbracket\n.\nend\n]\n.\nislower\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncompare\n\ue157\n\n\n\n\ndef\n \ncompare\n(\nname\n,\n \nfirst\n,\n \nsecond\n,\n \nbfr\n)\n\n\n\n\ncompare\n is run when comparing the opening bracket with the closing brackets.

The plugin itself is executed after a match is made.  When defining a manually invoked \nBH\n command, either \nbh_key\n or \nbh_async_key\n should be used (key referring to key binding, but is also used for the menu and command palette).  It may be misleading as to what \nbh_async_key\n means, but it is mainly a workaround to launch \nBH\n keys from the command palette.  The command is kicked off asynchronously to ensure the palette closes before executing, but the \nBH\n command itself is still synchronous.\n\n\nExample of run instance plugin getting called:\n\n\n// Go to left bracket\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nBracketHighlighter: Jump to Left Bracket\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nbh_key\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n\n        \n{\n\n            \nlines\n \n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n            \nplugin\n:\n\n            \n{\n\n                \ntype\n:\n \n[\n__all__\n],\n\n                \ncommand\n:\n \nbh_modules.bracketselect\n,\n\n                \nargs\n:\n \n{\nselect\n:\n \nleft\n}\n\n            \n}\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nargs\n parameter is a dictionary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlines\n\n\nShow the number of lines between the matched brackets in the status bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nno_outside_adj\n\n\nThis is a parameter used to tell the plugin to ignore the \nbracket_outside_adjacent\n setting.  This is by default used for the \nbracketselect\n commands to ignore outside adjacent matching so it can do expanding selections or jump to parents brackets.  The default is \nfalse\n when not defined, but it can be set to \ntrue\n or \nnull\n in JSON (it would be \nNone\n if defined directly in Python code).  When \nnull\n, the value will be read from \nignore_outside_adjacent_in_plugin\n setting in the \nbh_core.sublime-settings\n file for convenient altering of the behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplugin\n\n\nConfiguration for the plugin to be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nplugin\n parameter is a dictionary that contains 3 arguments that define which plugin should get run, under which circumstance it is run, and with what parameters it is run with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\n\n\nAn array containing the bracket definition names that the plugin should be run on.

This was a cumbersome requirement that also punished a user because if they did this, they wouldn't automatically get updates to the rules as all the rules were now overridden by the user's settings file.  BracketHighlighter now lets you add or modify existing rules without overriding the entire rule set, or even the entire target rule.  Let's say you have a custom language you want to have on your machine.

All you have to do is use the same name of the item you want to change. Only that attribute will be overridden:       user_brackets :   [ \n         // Angle \n         { \n             name :   angle , \n             language_list :   [ \n                 HTML ,   HTML 5 ,   XML ,   PHP ,   HTML (Rails) , \n                 HTML (Jinja Templates) ,   HTML (Jinja2) ,   HTML (Twig) , \n                 HTML+CFML ,   ColdFusion ,   ColdFusionCFC , \n                 laravel-blade ,   Handlebars ,   AngularJS , \n                 SomeNewLanguage   //  --- New language \n             ] \n         } \n     ],   Let's say you want to insert a new rule between two rules. You can turn on debug mode and call the  BracketHighlighter: (Debug) Filter Rules by Key , and then select  position  to see the current rule order and their position index.  To turn on Debug mode, just add  debug_enable :   true  to your user settings file.  Example of  BracketHighlighter: (Debug) Filter Rules by Key  output:  [ \n     [ \n         { name :   curly ,   position :   0 }, \n         { name :   round ,   position :   1 }, \n         { name :   square ,   position :   2 }, \n         { name :   html ,   position :   3 }, \n         { name :   cfml ,   position :   4 }, \n         { name :   php_angle ,   position :   5 }, \n         { name :   angle ,   position :   6 }, \n         { name :   cssedit_groups ,   position :   7 }, \n         { name :   ruby_embedded_html ,   position :   8 }, \n         { name :   ruby ,   position :   9 }, \n         { name :   c_compile_switch ,   position :   10 }, \n         { name :   php_keywords ,   position :   11 }, \n         { name :   erlang ,   position :   12 }, \n         { name :   bash ,   position :   13 }, \n         { name :   fish ,   position :   14 }, \n         { name :   mylang ,   position :   15 } \n     ], \n     [ \n         { name :   py_single_quote ,   position :   0 }, \n         { name :   py_double_quote ,   position :   1 }, \n         { name :   single_quote ,   position :   2 }, \n         { name :   double_quote ,   position :   3 }, \n         { name :   jsregex ,   position :   4 }, \n         { name :   perlregex ,   position :   5 }, \n         { name :   rubyregex ,   position :   6 }, \n         { name :   mditalic ,   position :   7 }, \n         { name :   mdbold ,   position :   8 } \n     ]  ]   Then you can specify the position you want to insert at using the  position  key:       user_scope_brackets :   [], \n     user_brackets :   [ \n         { \n             name :   mylang , \n             position :   4 ,   //  -- New position \n             open :   ^\\\\s*\\\\b(if|subr|bytemap|enum|command|for|while|macro|do)\\\\b , \n             close :   \\\\b(e(?:if|subr|bytemap|enum|command|for|while|macro)|until)\\\\b , \n             style :   default , \n             scope_exclude :   [ string ,   comment ], \n             plugin_library :   User.bh_modules.mylangkeywords , \n             language_filter :   whitelist , \n             language_list :   [ mylang ], \n             enabled :   true \n         } \n     ],   And if you run the debug command again, you will see that the position has changed:           { name :   curly ,   position :   0 }, \n         { name :   round ,   position :   1 }, \n         { name :   square ,   position :   2 }, \n         { name :   html ,   position :   3 }, \n         { name :   mylang ,   position :   4 },   //  -- New position \n         { name :   cfml ,   position :   5 }, \n         { name :   php_angle ,   position :   6 },   This can be used to adjust the position of default rules from your user settings as seen in the overrides above.  So, unless you are forking  BH  to pull request a change to the default rules, you can now modify the rules in just these two settings without copying or touching the default rules. This will allow you to make changes, but still receive new updated rules.       user_scope_brackets :   [], \n     user_brackets :   [],",

Parameter  Description      lines  Show the number of lines between the matched brackets in the status bar.    no_outside_adj  This is a parameter used to tell the plugin to ignore the  bracket_outside_adjacent  setting.  This is by default used for the  bracketselect  commands to ignore outside adjacent matching so it can do expanding selections or jump to parents brackets.  The default is  false  when not defined, but it can be set to  true  or  null  in JSON (it would be  None  if defined directly in Python code).

Then you provide a method called  plugin  that returns the class.   class   BracketPluginCommand ()   Attributes :     Attribute  Description      view  The sublime view containing the bracket (don't change this).    left  A bracket region for the opening bracket (can be changed).    right  A bracket region for the closing bracket (can be changed).    selection  An array containing the selection that triggered the match (can be changed).    refresh_match  A plugin can set this to  true  if the plugin has moved the cursor in such a way that the current highlighted match is no longer valid.  This will cause  BH  to setup another match when idle. An example of this is in the  bracketselect   bh_plugin ; the cursor can be moved outside the matching brackets requiring a refresh to match the parent when the command is complete.    nobracket  This was added mainly for sub-bracket matching (a bracket inside other brackets like round brackets in quotes/strings).  This is set to true if the plugin has caused both left and right brackets to be returned as  None  and it is not desired to fall back and match the parent.

            "text": "Extended Regex Guide\n\ue157\n\n\nOverview\n\ue157\n\n\nBH\n uses Python's Re regular expression engine, but it also adds some additional back references to aid in the creation of bracket patterns.  This is done with a custom wrapper called Backrefs that was originally written for \nRegReplace\n.\n\n\nBackrefs was written to add various additional back references that are known to some regex engines, but not to Python's Re.  Backrefs adds: \n\\p\n, \n\\P\n, \n\\u\n, \n\\U\n, \n\\l\n, \n\\L\n, \n\\Q\n or \n\\E\n (though \n\\u\n and \n\\U\n are replaced with \n\\c\n and \n\\C\n).\n\n\nYou can read more about Backrefs' features in \nBackrefs' documentation\n.\n\n\nGetting the Latest Backrefs\n\ue157\n\n\nIt is not always clear when Package Control updates dependencies.  So to force dependency updates, you can run Package Control's \nSatisfy Dependencies\n command which will update to the latest release.\n\n\nUsing Backrefs in BracketHighlighter Plugins\n\ue157\n\n\nYou can import Backrefs into a \nbh_plugin\n:\n\n\nfrom\n \nbackrefs\n \nas\n \nbre\n\n\n\n\n\nBackrefs does provide a wrapper for all of Re's normal functions such as \nmatch\n, \nsub\n, etc., but it is recommended to pre-compile your search patterns \nand\n your replace patterns for the best performance; especially if you plan on reusing the same pattern multiple times.  As Re does cache a certain amount of the non-compiled calls, you will be spared from some of the performance hit, but Backrefs does not cache the pre-processing of search and replace patterns.\n\n\nTo use pre-compiled functions, you compile the search pattern with \ncompile_search\n.  If you want to take advantage of replace Backrefs, you need to compile the replace pattern as well.  Notice the compiled pattern is fed into the replace pattern; you can feed the replace compiler the string representation of the search pattern as well, but the compiled pattern will be faster and is the recommended way.\n\n\npattern\n \n=\n \nbre\n.\ncompile_search\n(\nr\nsomepattern\n,\n \nflags\n)\n\n\nreplace\n \n=\n \nbre\n.\ncompile_replace\n(\npattern\n,\n \nr\n\\1 some replace pattern\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nThen you can use the complied search pattern and replace\n\n\ntext\n \n=\n \npattern\n.\nsub\n(\nreplace\n,\n \nr\nsometext\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n\nm\n \n=\n \npattern\n.\nmatch\n(\nr\nsometext\n)\n\n\nif\n \nm\n:\n\n    \ntext\n \n=\n \nreplace\n(\nm\n)\n  \n# similar to m.expand(template)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use the non-compiled search/replace functions, you call them just them as you would in Re; the names are the same.  Methods like \nsub\n and \nsubn\n will compile the replace pattern on the fly if given a string.\n\n\nfor\n \nm\n \nin\n \nbre\n.\nfinditer\n(\nr\nsomepattern\n,\n \nsome text\n,\n \nbre\n.\nUNICODE\n \n|\n \nbre\n.\nDOTALL\n):\n\n    \n# do something\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to replace without compiling, you can use the \nexpand\n method.\n\n\nm\n \n=\n \nbre\n.\nmatch\n(\nr\nsometext\n)\n\n\nif\n \nm\n:\n\n    \ntext\n \n=\n \nbre\n.\nexpand\n(\nm\n,\n \nr\nreplace pattern\n)",

This is done with a custom wrapper called Backrefs that was originally written for  RegReplace .  Backrefs was written to add various additional back references that are known to some regex engines, but not to Python's Re.  Backrefs adds:  \\p ,  \\P ,  \\u ,  \\U ,  \\l ,  \\L ,  \\Q  or  \\E  (though  \\u  and  \\U  are replaced with  \\c  and  \\C ).

As Re does cache a certain amount of the non-compiled calls, you will be spared from some of the performance hit, but Backrefs does not cache the pre-processing of search and replace patterns.  To use pre-compiled functions, you compile the search pattern with  compile_search .  If you want to take advantage of replace Backrefs, you need to compile the replace pattern as well.  Notice the compiled pattern is fed into the replace pattern; you can feed the replace compiler the string representation of the search pattern as well, but the compiled pattern will be faster and is the recommended way.  pattern   =   bre . compile_search ( r somepattern ,   flags )  replace   =   bre . compile_replace ( pattern ,   r \\1 some replace pattern )   Then you can use the complied search pattern and replace  text   =   pattern . sub ( replace ,   r sometext )   or  m   =   pattern . match ( r sometext )  if   m : \n     text   =   replace ( m )    # similar to m.expand(template)   To use the non-compiled search/replace functions, you call them just them as you would in Re; the names are the same.  Methods like  sub  and  subn  will compile the replace pattern on the fly if given a string.  for   m   in   bre . finditer ( r somepattern ,   some text ,   bre . UNICODE   |   bre . DOTALL ): \n     # do something   If you want to replace without compiling, you can use the  expand  method.  m   =   bre . match ( r sometext )  if   m : \n     text   =   bre . expand ( m ,   r replace pattern )",
